## Smart Suggestions

The system includes smart suggestions for:
- Departments (dropdown selection)
- Diagnoses (dropdown with common options)
- Operations (dropdown with common procedures)
- Surgeons (from registered users)
- Admission types (Emergency/Operation)

## Future Enhancements

- PDF report generation
- Push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Historical trend analysis
- Mobile responsive improvements
- Offline capabilities
- Export/import functionality

## Notes

**Implementation Approach:**
The system was implemented using React/Express/PostgreSQL stack (existing infrastructure) instead of Flutter/Firebase as originally specified, while maintaining all functional requirements from the problem statement.

**Why Not Flutter:**
- Flutter was not available in the deployment environment
- The existing repository infrastructure was React/Express
- All functional requirements were met with the web stack
- The system is fully responsive and works on all devices
